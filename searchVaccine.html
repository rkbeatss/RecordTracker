It can be complicated by breathing problems, heart failure and nerve damage. Diphtheria kills about one out of every 10 people who get the disease. It is most often passed to others through coughing and sneezing.

While most infected people experience no or mild symptoms, some become severely ill for several months.

It is a hepadnavirus (hepa from hepatotropic – infectious and replicating in the liver – and dna because it is a DNA virus). Once contracted, the virus replicates in the liver and spreads to the blood. Most people who get infected with hepatitis B develop the acute form of the disease. The illness just lasts for just a few weeks and most recover fully. Yet, few people may develop severe liver disease (fulminant hepatic failure) and may even die as a result.</td>

The infection attacks motor neurons and gradually causes paralysis and an inability to survive without life support. The term Poliomyelitis comes from the Greek terms polios and myelos, which mean “grey” and “marrow,” while the suffix itis is commonly used to describe inflammation.</td>
